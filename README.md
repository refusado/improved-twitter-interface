# Improved Twitter Interface

This is a study project where I am recreating an improved version of the Twitter interface using React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The main goal is to show that even big apps can always be improved, even if in minor aspects, since small details can also influence the user experience.

## Improvements

- **Enhanced Performance**: The application will offer improved performance, ensuring faster load times and smoother interactions.

- **Visual Fixes/Improvements**: Minor unintuitive and unstandardized behaviors present in the original Twitter interface will be changed to achieve a better UX.

- **Increased Responsiveness**: The improvements in responsiveness make the application functional, navigable and continue providing a good experience on a larger variety of screens.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest version recommended)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/refusado/improved-twitter-interface.git
   cd improved-twitter-interface
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application in action.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files ready for deployment.

## Previewing Production Build

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server to showcase the optimized production build.
